refrasierator uses [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) to generate dialogue from transcripts of Frasier episodes.

This expects that you have a `transcripts/raw` directory containing episode transcripts with names like `s04e03.txt`. 
Such transcripts exist elsewhere, so I am not hosting them here.
